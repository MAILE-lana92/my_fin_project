Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Important notice
The data has been modified: trends and insights remain accurate, but the number of transactions has been scaled by a factor of n. The actual transaction amounts are for my reference only. Please refrain from drawing conclusions about the transaction count.

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
